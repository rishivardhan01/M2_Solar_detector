# INTRODUCTION
 A solar tracker is a device that allows an object to be positioned at an angle to the Sun. Placing photovoltaic (PV) panels (solar panels) so that they remain perpendicular to the Sun's beams and positioning space telescopes so that they can identify the Sun's direction are two of the most prevalent uses for solar trackers.

# OBJECTIVES
 The solar tracker's objectives are as follows: Within a 5o margin of error, track the sun across the sky. With the assistance of a controller, the tracker can be manually rotated along the whole ecliptic. Each cell's power output should also be displayed by the device.
 
# COMPONENTS REQUIRED
 * ATMEGA328
 * SERVO MOTOR
 * LDR

## DESCRIPTION
# ATMEGA328
 Atmel's megaAVR series includes the ATmega328, a single-chip microcontroller (later Microchip Technology acquired Atmel in 2016). It has an 8-bit RISC processing core based on Harvard architecture. The Atmel 8-bit AVR RISC-based microcontroller combines 32 KB ISP flash memory with read-while-write capabilities, 1 KB EEPROM, 2 KB SRAM, 23 general-purpose I/O lines, 32 general-purpose working registers, 3 flexible timer/counters with compare modes, internal and external interrupts, serial programmable USART, a byte-oriented 2-wire serial interface, SPI serial port, 6-channel 10-bit A/D converter (8 The device has a voltage range of 1.8 to 5.5 volts. The gadget has a throughput of about 1 MIPS/MHz.
 
 # SERVO MOTOR
  A servomotor (also known as a servomotor) is a rotary or linear actuator that provides for precise control of angular or linear position, velocity, and acceleration.It is made comprised of an appropriate motor and a position feedback sensor. It also necessitates a complex controller, which is frequently a separate module created exclusively for servomotorsAlthough the term servomotor is typically used to refer to a motor appropriate for use in a closed-loop control system, it is not a specific type of motor.Servomotors are utilised in robotics, CNC machines, and automated manufacturing, among other uses.
  
 # LDR
  A photoresistor (also known as a Photocell, LDR, or photo-conductive cell) is a passive component that decreases resistance in response to receiving brightness (light) on its sensitive surface. A photoresistor's resistance lowers as the incident light intensity increases; in other words, it is photoconductive. As a resistance semiconductor, a photoresistor can be used in light-sensitive detector circuits and light-activated and dark-activated switching circuits. In the dark, a photoresistor can have a resistance of many megaohms (M), whereas in the light, it can have a resistance of only a few hundred ohms.

# WORKING
 In essence, a low boiling point compressed gas fluid is pushed to one side or the other to move the tracker like a teeter totter in response to the heat from the sun creating an imbalance.
 
# ADVANTAGES
  Due to increased direct exposure to sun rays, trackers generate more electricity than stationary equivalents. Depending on the geographic location of the tracking device, this increase can range from 10% to 25%.Solar trackers come in a variety of configurations, including single-axis and dual-axis trackers, each of which can be tailored to a specific jobsite. The size of the solar installation, the weather in the area, the degree of latitude, and the electrical requirements are all factors that might influence the type of solar tracker that is best suited for a certain solar installation.Solar trackers produce more electricity in roughly the same amount of space as fixed-tilt systems, making them excellent for land use optimization.
  
# DISADVANTAGES
  Due to the more complex technology and moving parts required for their functioning, solar trackers are slightly more expensive than their stationary counterparts. Depending on the size and location of the project, this usually amounts to a $0.08 â€“ $0.10/W increase.
Even with the improvements in reliability, solar trackers still require more maintenance than typical fixed racks, albeit the quality of the solar tracker can influence how much and how often this maintenance is required.
Fixed racking is a simpler arrangement than trackers. This usually necessitates additional site preparation, such as additional trenching for wiring and some grading.
Single-axis tracker projects necessitate a greater emphasis on the company's stability and bankability.
